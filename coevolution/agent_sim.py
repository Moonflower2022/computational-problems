# idea: 
# two (or n) virus strains
# population of people
# the viruses have different genotypes, and can mutate when reproducing
# the humans have immune systems of varying strength
# after some time they develop cells to counter the virus
# after a really long time they develop vaccines against specific strains of viruses
