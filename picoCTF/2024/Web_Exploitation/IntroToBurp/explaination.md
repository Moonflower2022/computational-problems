# explaination

I got sent to a page with a form, when filled out sent me to a page asking for a OTP (one time password)

I tried a few things but they all said "invalid OTP"

i looked at the hints and they said to use "burp"

I searched it up and found that it was a security testing software

i used that and some tutorials to intercept and change the http requests

the thing i changed that solved it was the "content-type" attribute
