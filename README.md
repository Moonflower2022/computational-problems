  * `polya's_urn_sim.py`: simulation of [polya's urn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%B3lya_urn_model)
  * `reality_game.py`: simulation, analysis, and plotting of graphs for `reality_game.pdf`
* `COMAP`: an imcomplete (and rushed) solution to [the 2023 HiMCM problem A](https://www.contest.comap.com/highschool/contests/himcm/2023_Problems/2023_HiMCM_Problem_A.pdf)
* `graphing_csv`: at one point i had a buncha csv files i wanted to see; script for plotting them

* `picoCTF`: solutions to problems from [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/)
  * one from 2021
  * a bunch from 2024
* `project_euler`: solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

* `markov_chain.py`: script i wrote with help from an instructor during a one-off lesson
  * supposed to take input from a txt
